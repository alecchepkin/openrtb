# OpenRTB 2.3.1 for PHP

This library has been created for PHP developers using the OpenRTB protocol. It provides a very lightweight wrapper to create, validate, and hydrate **Bid Requests** and **Bid Responses**. Getting started could not be easier, find our package on packagist: https://packagist.org/packages/olegre/OpenRTB

Install by adding { .. "olegre/OpenRTB": "0.1" .. } to your composer.json file.

The wrapper requires Guzzle. This can be used to further extends the library where required. More information about Guzzle can be found here: http://guzzle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

### Installing via Composer

The recommended way to install Guzzle is through
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

```bash
# Install Composer
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Next, run the Composer command to install the latest stable version of Guzzle:

```bash
composer.phar require olegre/OpenRTB
```

After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

### PHP Examples

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

//Create instance of a Bid Response
$bidResponse = new \OpenRTB\BidResponse();

//Set the Bid Response id
$bidResponse->set('id','ABC123');

//Create instance of a Bid model
$bid = new \OpenRTB\Models\Bid();

//Set the Bid Response attributes
$bid->set('id','ABC123');
$bid->set('impid','ABC123');
$bid->set('price',1.2);

//Create instance of a Seat Bid model
$seatBid = new \OpenRTB\Models\SeatBid();

//Attach the Bid model to the Seat Bid model
$seatBid->set('bid',array(
  $bid
));

//Attach Seat Bid model to the Bid Response
$bidResponse->set('seatbid',$seatBid);

//Output the Bid Reponse as JSON
var_dump($bidResponse->getDataAsJson());
```
